This project will guide me through the initial process of creating an identical page to the Google Homepage.

Link to project https://github.com/rafapdc80/google-homepage.git

I expect to have some difficulties as I have never done this before in my life.

What were some of the problems I have encountered?

<-- Resizing and positioning files is harder than it seems at first and getting things to properly line up is something I will have to work on.-->

What lessons have I learned along the way?

<-- Learned to use a basic html template to get started with the project, saving time by not having to type everything.-->

How would I grade what I've learned?
